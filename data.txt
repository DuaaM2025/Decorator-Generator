Reading Files Using Generators in Python

Based on my study of Python generators, this project demonstrates how to read files efficiently using a generator function. Generators allow producing values one at a time with yield instead of returning all values at once.

This approach is useful when working with large files because it:

Reads the file line by line.

Does not load the entire file into memory.

Enables memory-efficient processing of large datasets.
